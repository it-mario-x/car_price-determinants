# What Drives the Price of a Car?

We will analyse what are the factors that make a car more or less expensive. 

For this analysis, we will follow these steps:

- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment

The potential used car dealer will find the final report in the deployment section.

Our analysis focuses on defining the business need. Then, a data understanding and preparation make sure we have a cleaned set of data (i.e. no missing and coherent values) with no considerable data loss. We then proceed to two different models wich will allows to know wich features can be discarded from the driving factors of a used car price.
